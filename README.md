# λ Lambda Function • A Type-Safe Space

[![Lint](https://github.com/actualwitch/news/actions/workflows/lint.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/actualwitch/news/actions/workflows/lint.yml)

Lambda Function is a love letter to nerds everywhere; and a desperate plea for unification, before we are all divided and conquered. It is a celebration of functional programming and mathematics, science and art, humanity and its creations. But above all else, Lambda Function is you. It is all of us, together.

## Development

This project includes [Tilt](https://tilt.dev/) configuration for local development with auxillary services run in kubernetes, however you will need to have Rust and `cargo-leptos` installed locally. To start the development environment, run:

```sh
tilt up
